= Authlogic+MongoMapper monkey

This rails plugin is a set of patches both to authlogic and mongomapper to make them work together.

Part of these patches is jnunemaker-validatable fixes (required by authlogic)

Also this plugin tries to adapt authlogic_openid automatically (if found)

== Install
Just do:

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/cail/authlogic_mongomapper_monkey.git

== Usage

<b>Draft and unstable! Use on your own risk.</b>

Install and just follow authlogic guides for model and session definition.

Of course, model should be defined as a MongoMapper::Document, all the attributes required by authlogic should
be defined in mongomapper style, like:

    key :name, String
    key :email, String

    key :crypted_password, String
    key :password_salt, String
    key :persistence_token, String
    key :single_access_token, String
    key :perishable_token, String

    key :login_count, Integer, :default => 0, :null => false
    key :failed_login_count, Integer, :default => 0, :null => false
    key :last_request_at, Time
    key :current_login_at, Time
    key :last_login_at, Time
    key :current_login_ip, String
    key :last_login_ip, String

    # created_at, updated_at, helpers
    timestamps!

Since authlogic depends on model attributes, only after above key definitions do

    acts_as_authentic

and use any of authlogic configuration stuff
